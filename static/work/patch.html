	<h1>ANTICA</h1>
	<p>
		We don’t have any formal training
		in mark·etinq and it shows. We are
		nondoqmatic and generally don’t care
		about existing rules or protocols.
		We blur the lines between account
		and creative personnel and encourage
		our teams to get completely immersed
		in solving business problems. We
		speak to our clients in normal
		language rather than jargon. We treat
		our clients, and their customers,
		as humans, not as metrics or
		demogiaphics. What we do care about
		is success. We want to keep our
		campaigns and our jobs interesting
		and imaginative. We did not set out
		to compete on level ground with
		other advertising agencies, so we
		use asymmetrical tactics to get
		results, often big one’s. We believe
		in ourselves and we believe in our
		clients. It shows in our work. If
		you are a great organization or
		cornpany, and want to do something
		oriqinal, please give us a call. If
		you want to roll out another same-old
		seasonal campaign around a mundane
		and tired product, differentiated
		from its competition only by
		branding, p1ease call someone else.
