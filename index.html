		<h1>About Us</h1>
		<div id="twoColoumContent">
			DOT DOT DASH is an independent marketing firm specializing
			in the development of handcrafted content and
			communications. Our practice leans towards the digital
			and social landscapes, but extends into fully integrated
			services. With scalable production capacity, we focus on
			busine.sses and organizations that stand for something and
			who want to use communication for good. We only work with
			great and virtuous organizations to ensure that our clients
			are always in good company. We inspire action through
			love, story, conversation and the building of communities.
			We believe more in long-term commitments to communications
			with customers and less in ‘one off’ campaigns. OUr goal is
			to foster a series of strategic conversations that keep our
			clients’ brands top of mind. We value sustainable growth
			over instant solutions. We believe in using technology
			to help brands build cultural relevance. We partner with
			visionary clients to build strategies that instigate
			dialogue and experience. We create work that people
			want to know about and be a part of. We create things
			that are optimistic, inclusive, valuable and relevant.
			We’re as tired of today’s over-saturated media landscape
			and inauthentic brand messaging as you are. Like many,
			we got tired of being sold crap that we didn’t need or
			want. So we decided to do something about it by creating
			a new business hardwired to work in a new economy with
			a new consumner. We encourage our clients to be honest,
			progressive and transparent and help find ways for the
			market to reward them for being this way. We also encourage
			our clients to be smart, strategic and original. We do
			this because we believe in these values ourselves and
			we believe the consumer deserves better than what they
			are getting today. We care about nature, connnunity and
			culture and we care about integrity and imagination.

		<h1>Our Process</h1>
		<div id="twoColoumContent">
			We don’t have any formal training in mark·etinq and it
			shows. We are nondoqmatic and generally don’t care about
			existing rules or protocols. We blur the lines between
			account and creative personnel and encourage our teams to
			get completely immersed in solving business problems. We
			speak to our clients in normal language rather than jargon.
			We treat our clients, and their customers, as humans,
			not as metrics or demogiaphics. What we do care about
			is success. We want to keep our campaigns and our jobs
			interesting and imaginative. We did not set out to compete
			on level ground with other advertising agencies, so we use
			asymmetrical tactics to get results, often big one’s. We
			believe in ourselves and we believe in our clients. It shows
			in our work. If you are a great organization or cornpany,
			and want to do something oriqinal, please give us a call.
			If you want to roll out another same-old seasonal campaign
			around a mundane and tired product, differentiated from
			its competition only by branding, p1ease call someone else.
